  <h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
  <br>
  <h6>What Is Renewable Energy?</h6>
  <p class="a">Renewable energy is energy that has been derived from earth's natural resources that
    are not finite or exhaustible, such as wind and sunlight. Renewable energy is an alternative
    to the traditional energy that relies on fossil fuels, and it tends to be much
    less harmful to the environment.</p>

  <br>
  <h6>Effects the environment</h6>
  <p class="a">Although renewable energy sources produce relatively low levels of GHG emissions and conventional air pollution, manufacturing and transporting them will produce some emissions and pollutants. The production of some photovoltaic (PV) cells, for instance, generates toxic substances that may contaminate water resources.</p>

  <br>
  <h6>Advantages of Using Renewable Energy</h6>
  <p class="a">The advantages of renewable energy have been known for a very long time - such as cleaner air, lower carbon emissions, the conservation of natural resources, and substantial long-term savings.</p>
  <p class="a">So, let's explore the advantages and disadvantages of renewable energy, discover more about its unique benefits, and focus on the challenges we still need to overcome.</p>

  <button class="accordion">A Fuel Supply That Never Runs Out</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p class="a">As the name suggests, renewable energy is created from sources that naturally replenish themselves - such as sunlight, wind, water, biomass, and even geothermal (underground) heat.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Zero Carbon Emissions</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p class="a">Perhaps the most significant benefit of renewable energy is that there are no greenhouse gasses or other pollutants created during the process. Whereas coal power plants create around 2.2 pounds of CO2 for every kilowatt-hour of electricity - solar panels and wind turbines create none at all.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Cleaner Air and Water</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p class="a">Burning fossil fuels to generate electricity does far more than warm the climate; it also contaminates the air we breathe and the water we drink.</p>
    <p class="a">Coal power stations, for example, release high volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) directly into the atmosphere - two of the most potent greenhouse gasses. But in addition, they also emit mercury, lead, sulfur dioxide, particulates, and dangerous metals - which can cause a host of health problems ranging from breathing difficulties to premature death. </p>
    <p class="a">On the other hand, renewable energy creates no pollution, waste, or contamination risks to air and water. And while the COVID-19 lockdowns gave us a glimpse of clear skies in major cities all over the world, renewable energy has the potential to make clean air the new normal.</p>
