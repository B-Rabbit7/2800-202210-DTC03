    <h3>Temperature Changes</h3>
    <h6>A Brief History</h6>
    <p>For the past hundred years, our civilization has changed from building skyscrapers to the creation of the internet. Along with these changes, the world has changed with it and not for the better.</p>
    <h6>What's the issue?</h6>
    <p>Our effects on the world, through industrial revolution, have caused an increase in global temperature. 
      This temperature increase has led to an increase in droughts, irregularity of seasons, rising sea levels, and many more environmental changes.</p>
    <h6>What have we done to prevent it?</h6>
    <p>On December 12, 2015, 196 parties signed the Paris Agreement with the hopes of preventing the drastic outcomes of climate change. 
      The main goal of the Paris Agreement was to have each participant prepare a plan of action to reduce their national emissions called nationally determined contributions, NDCs, to combat climate change.</p>
